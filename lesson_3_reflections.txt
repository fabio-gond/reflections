When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I collaborate with other people, when I want to show my project to other people, when I want to update the project from more than one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because Git is a little annoying.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    - Forks is used to clone a repository from a github account to myself account
    - Clone is used to create a copy of a repository localy or from a github account.
    - Branches are used to create different version of a project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    I can always know what changes have been made.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    We can collaborate with a cloud service, but they have no commits, so it would be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When I want to have a feedback from other collaborator before add my changes to the master branch.
